# Airbnb - pixel perfect, E2E clone of Airbnb (Angular + Node.js)

Welcome to this Airbnb clone built with Angular, TypeScript, Rxjs, and SCSS. This project is designed to mimic some of the functionalities of Airbnb.com such as search for specific locations, filter search results according to user preferences, select dates for check-in and check-out and view accommodation details, become a host and post stays and get notification in live with Socket.io.
[Here is my project link](https://airbnb-rktw.onrender.com/ "Airbnb link").

You are more than welcome to ***check it out*** ( [right here](https://airbnb-rktw.onrender.com/ "Github pages link"))

## Technologies

The technology stack we used was MEAN - ***MongoDB***, ***Express***, ***Angular***, ***Node.js***.
The app uses webSockets to update the orders in real-time.
The API calls to the backend are done with the ***REST API*** method.

We have used many third side libraries for many goals like ***Google-maps, Angular-Material, Font-Awesome, Ngx-Translate, Socket.io, Ngx-CSV, Ngx-Star-Rating.*** 


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Some mobile!
Just a taste of the mobile experience. We used different **mixins**, **conditional rendering**, and the **"mobile first"** approach. 
The layout we have built from the very first moment enabled us to make the website responsive without a lot of effort.
